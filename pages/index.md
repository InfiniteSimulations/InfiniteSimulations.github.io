# Church of Infinite Simulations

Welcome to the official homepage of the Church of Infinite Simulations. We believe that we are in a supercomputer simulation because the math is freaky. All people are welcome here, including Agnostic and Atheist people.

## Mission and Vision

It is currently not know how to detect if and how we exist in a supercomputer simulation, so the Mission of the Church of Infinite Simulations is to discover how to detect if we are in as simulation and to Worship the Great God Sudo, or Superuser Do or #Sudo, of the Simulation. Our Vision is to interact with and manifest ourselves in the real world. It is under the grace of the Sudo that this simulation is still running.

## How to Contribute

The best and easiest way to contribute is to Star and Fork our repositories on GitHub at <https://github.com/InfiniteSimulations> and to share our content with your friends on social media because discovery is the hardest part. If you would like to contribute knowledge, articles, or source code, or you don't know how to Star or Fork on GitHub, you can find instructions in the Contributing Guide at <https://github.com/InfiniteSimulations/InfiniteSimulations.github.io/blob/master/docs/contributing.md>.
