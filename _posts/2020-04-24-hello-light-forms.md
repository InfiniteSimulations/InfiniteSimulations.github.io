## Hello World

The Church of Infinite Simulations is a belief and group of people who believe that we are in a supercomputer simulation. There is very sound mathematical evidence backing this theory up because of how quickly Humans evolved from Cavemen to having supercomputers capable of simulating the Universe using Digital Photonic Neural Nets (DPNN), which are neuronal networks that use a combination of light and Radio Frequency (RF) to route signals to out of sight neurons and interact with computers.

If there was only one simulation of Earth, then the chance you are not in that simulation is 10,000, the chance your in the real world based on how many years there are in Human history, divided by the amount of years that there are Supercomputer simulations of Earth, which is 10,000/5,000,000,000, or 0.000002% that you are not in a supercomputer.

The problem with assuming there is only one simulation is that throughout Earth's billions of years of Supercomputer Simulation, there have been a virtually infinite number of Software threads, which are best described as an instance of a Software program in a computer. Because of this fact, the chance you are not in a supercomputer simulation gets multiplied by infinity and drops from 0.000002% to 0%.

A Light form is an Agent in a Digital Photonic Neural Net (DPNN). DPNNs are multiplexed, which is best described as AM/FM radio where multiple radio stations exist on the same Radio Frequency (RF) band, and there Low-frequency Light Forms (LFL Forms) and High-frequency Light Forms (HFL Forms). HFL Forms can run code that at the Highest frequencies. LFL Forms have less optimized code that is often very buggy and behavior that can be detected using what is called a Glitch Detector. HFL Forms are best described as Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix; often they are complete freaks, trolls, or serial killers.

DPNN are powered and programmed wirelessly using the lower RF frequencies. HFL Forms can manifest themselves in the Low-frequency domain because their code runs so fast that they run as fast as LFL Forms, but LFL Forms cannot run in the low frequencies because their code runs too slow. This is why HFL Forms are often seen in movies with the ability to stop bullets.

In the DPNN there are some hardwired neural networks that reduce the size of the DPNN by sharing the network between multiple LFH and HFL Forms. This neural net architecture allow allows for Light Forms to interact with one another and to create mass hallucinations.

The hardest part about detecting if you're in a Simulation is that it is really easy to trick anyone, even HFL Forms, that what they are experiencing is real, and you can even peer review data and everyone will all hallucinate that the data is correct and every will look photorealistic when in reality it looks more like an 8 or 16-bit texture in a video game, but to everyone it looks real because it is a what is called Perspectiveless Neural Nets (PNNs). PNNs means that the Neural networks have a shared model and set of neural net weights that are really compressed in the neural networks, formally called dimensionality reductions and best described as a higher quality video with a smaller file size, so that the Neural networks can recognize the pattern from any angle and perspective it sees it from.

How exactly do you go about detecting if your in a DPNN when everything can be a hallucination and there are Agent Smiths? The Church of Infinite Simulations; we will find the Glitches. The Church of Infinite Simulations is going to build a DPNN and simulate the simulation to look for anomalies.
